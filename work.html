    <h3>The PDF linked to the above title and additionally linked on the bottom line of the following paragraph is a report of my work on the Active-Rx project at the Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory at the University of Washington, under the guidance of Dr. Shwetak Patel and Parker Ruth.
            <br><br>The app generally aimed to classify between and count repetitions of upper body movement exercises that 
            sedentary obese, disabled, or elderly individuals might do. <br>
            To achieve this, my fellow intern and I first created a <a href = https://parkersruth.github.io/web-doppler-sensing/motion.html>data collection webapp</a> 
            using Javascript and PHP. 
            <br><br>We then used this data to create a threshold model to count repetitions, a binary convolutional neural network 
            (CNN) to distinguish between two exercises based on accelerometer and gyroscope data, and 
            a multi-class CNN exercise classifier utilizing audio data and the principle of doppler motion.
