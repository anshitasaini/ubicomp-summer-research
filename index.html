    <h3>The PDF linked to the above title and additionally linked on the bottom line of the following paragraph is a report of my work on the Active-Rx project at the Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory at the University of Washington, under the guidance of Dr. Shwetak Patel and Parker Ruth.
            
	    

	    
	    
	    <br><br>The app, Active-Rx, generally aimed to quantify upper body movement exercises that 
            sedentary obese, disabled, or elderly individuals might do instead of walking. <br><br>
            To achieve this, my fellow intern and I worked on the novel sensing aspect of the app. first created a <a href = https://parkersruth.github.io/web-doppler-sensing/motion.html>data collection webapp</a> 
            using Javascript and PHP. 
            <br><br> We additionally created and are continuing to work on 
	    a multi-class CNN exercise classifier utilizing audio data and the principle of doppler motion,
	    a binary convolutional neural network 
            (CNN) to distinguish between two exercises based on accelerometer and gyroscope data,
	    and lastly, two threshold models to count reptitions of exercises based on both
	    gyroscope and audio data, all written in Python.
